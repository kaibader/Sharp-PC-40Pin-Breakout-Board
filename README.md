# Sharp-PC-Breakout-Boards
Various Breakout Boards for the Sharp PC-1500/1600 Series


## 40-Pin Cartridge Breakout Boards for the Sharp PC-1500/1600 Series

### v1.0
I've ported the two breakout boards from EagleCAD to KiCad.
The design of two breakout boards was also slightly improved.
There is no functional difference to the older revisions.

### v0.1
Initial release, designed in EagleCAD (which I'm not using anymore).

## Breakout Board for 60 Pin Connector of the Sharp PC-1500/PC-1600 Series
The breakout board was designed to allow easy access to all pins of the Sharp PC connector.

### v1.0
Upated the connector layout: Fixed an issue with a falsely documented FGND pin. Slight improvements in the layout.

### v0.2
Replaced the 1.27 mm pin header: the HIF6A-60PA-1.27DS is compatible with the discontinued JAE PICL-60P-LT (original Sharp-PC connector).
The whole PCB was redesigned: functional units (e.g. data bus, address bus) are now combined.

### v0.1
Initial release, based on a 1.27 mm pin header. Designed in EagleCAD (which I'm not using anymore).
