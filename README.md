# Breakout Board for 60 Pin Connector of the Sharp PC-1500/PC-1600 Series
The breakout board was designed to allow easy access to all pins of the Sharp PC connector.

## v1.0
Upated the connector layout: Fixed an issue with a falsely documented FGND pin. Slight improvements in the layout.

## v0.2
Replaced the 1.27 mm pin header: the HIF6A-60PA-1.27DS is compatible with the discontinued JAE PICL-60P-LT (original Sharp-PC connector).
The whole PCB was redesigned: functional units (e.g. data bus, address bus) are now combined.

## v0.1
Initial release, based on a 1.27 mm pin header. Designed in EagleCAD (which I'm not using anymore).
